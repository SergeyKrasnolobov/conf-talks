Yep, @wSokra has angel&devil in one body 😅

👼 Angel: add a better description to error, improve docs
👹 Devil: make it cryptic that no one can understand it and find an existed solution in the docs

I always try to avoid work with webpack as long as possible. Because some small improvement in bundling may eat days of work. Anyway, I love webpack, but cry with it 😜❤️
